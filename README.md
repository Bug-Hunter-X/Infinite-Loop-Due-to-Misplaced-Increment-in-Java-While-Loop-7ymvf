This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Java: an infinite loop caused by a misplaced increment in a `while` loop. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version. The error is that the increment of i is only performed inside the if statement resulting in an infinite loop. This example highlights the importance of careful loop control structure.
